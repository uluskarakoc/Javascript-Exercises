# CONSOLE.LOG EXERCISES: Getting Started 

These exercises are aimed at making you familiar with using node to run your scripts & the console.log method. For each exercise, run your script in node to check if your console.log(s) are working. Remember to use camelCase where needed.

## Instructions
- Work in the file `solution.js`  

1. Console log this line of text: "This is an exercise in console logging" (do not forget quotation marks). 

2. Declare a variable called `exercise` and give it the following value: "This is the value.". Console log the `exercise` **variable**. 

3. Declare a variable called `firstName` and assign your first name to that variable. Also create a `lastName` variable and assign your last name. Console log both variables in the order firstName, lastName. NOTE: When console logging two variables, separate the variables with a comma (,) in the console log e.g. console.log(variable1, variable2);

4. Make a profile of yourself. Store all the information in additional variables. To the existing ones `firstName` and `lastName` add `city`, `job` and `age`. Console log the variables in the order firstName, lastName, age, city, job. 

5. Print a sentence using all the profile variables above, adding text for sentence flow in the following format: "John Smith is a 43-year-old teacher who lives in Berlin". Replace parts of this string with your variables. **you can combine variables with text in the console by using the plus symbol (+) e.g. console.log("this is a " + variable);**
