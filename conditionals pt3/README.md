# Programming Basics: Conditionals Part 3 
[![Status overview badge](../../blob/badges/.github/badges/main/badge.svg)](#-results)


Attempt this exercise using only simple "if" conditionals (and only what you have learnt this far into the course, so no loops, functions or arrays just yet!) 

- work in the file `solution.js`

**Print your results to the console**

 Aleeza and Lara both play basketball in different teams. In the latest 3 games, Aleeza's team scored *89*, *120* and *103* points, while Lara's team scored *116*, *94* and *123* points.

- 1) Calculate the average score for each team, assign them to the variables `aleezaTeamAve` and `laraTeamAve`.
- 2) Write a condition that prints this in the terminal: _"Lara's team is the winner with an average score of ...."_ or _"Aleeza's team is the winner with an average score of ...."_ or "It's a tie with an average score of ...." according to which team has the higher average score or in case of a draw. Don't forget to include the actual average score in your answer (filling the ....)
- 3) Then change the score of aleeza's first game from *89* to *200* and calculate the new average, assign it to the new variable `aleezaTeamAve2`, write a new condition (similar to the previous one) to compare `aleezaTeamAve2` to `laraTeamAve`.
- 4) Mary also plays basketball, and her team scored *200*, *134* and *105* points. Like before, log the average winner (`laraTeamAve`, `aleezaTeamAve2` or `maryTeamAve`) to the console, (in case 2 teams are tied for 1st place print this: _"....'s team and ....'s team are tied for first place with an average score of ...."_, in case all 3 teams are tied: _"All three teams are tied with an average score of ...."_ after filling the spaces with the actual teams' names.... )
- 5) Like before, change the score of mary's first game from *200* to *184* to generate different winners, assign the new average to `maryTeamAve2`, rewrite the condition, keeping in mind that there might be draws.
