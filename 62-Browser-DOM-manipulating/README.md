# The Book List
[![Status overview badge](../../blob/badges/.github/badges/main/badge.svg)](#-results)


Create a personalized book website! Instead of adding all of the details of books in HTML, add data on the page from the `books` array in `assets/js/index.js` using JavaScript.

## Book Details

Display the book details on the page, such as author's name, book title and reading status. the author's name should be inside `<p>` tag. The book cover should appear above the book details and the image should link to the URL of the book cover.

## Status

The styling of reading status should be updated depending on whether the book has been read - the bootstrap badge style should change as well as the text, which should appear as "Read".

## Order

The authors' last names should appear first e.g. "Smith, John". Furthermore, the books should be displayed on the page in alphabetical order according to the authors' last names.

**Notes**:

- Work with the `index.html` and `assets/js/index.js` files provided in this repository.
- Add bootstrap styling where necessary. See the reference images for result.
