# Baking Box
[![Status overview badge](../../blob/badges/.github/badges/main/badge.svg)](#-results)


Populate a website with details of recipes!

**Instructions**:
* In the `scripts/data.js` file, you can find a data structure for the details of recipes. 
* Export the data structure as a JSON string.
* Import the JSON string and parse to variable named `parsedData` in the `scripts/index.js` file.
* In the `index.js` file, create a program that populates the `parsedData` from into the website. The page should display every recipe as a card that includes the recipe image, title, author and ingredients. 
* Make sure that each recipe is populated in the **correct** section, that is, cake recipes should be under the section "cakes" etc. 
* Note: Trouble getting started? Take the time to read what messages are printed into your terminal.
* Note: Still trouble getting started? Ask for assistance :)
