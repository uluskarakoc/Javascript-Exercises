# Menu Styling 
[![Status overview badge](../../blob/badges/.github/badges/main/badge.svg)](#-results)

In the repository, there is an `index.html` starting file which has the skeleton of an online menu. Style the menu by following the instructions below. 

**Rules**: 
* All changes to the menu should be done in JavaScript! No CSS!!
* The page should be responsive.

**Instructions**: 
* Change the font of the body element. 
* Center the text of h1 on the page.
* The menu headings have the class `.category`. Select the elements by class name. Then, change the `color` and `font-style` of each element. 
* Create a function named `colorGenerator` that returns a random color. The returned color should also include transparency.
* Select the unordered lists with the class `.food-category`. Give each list a different background color using the function that you created. 
* Align the `.food-category` lists in a row on desktop. Make sure that the page is responsive and also works on mobile.
* Select the warning at the end of the page by its id `#warning`. Select the id without using `querySelector`. Change the size and font of `.warning`.
* Select all _even_ `.allergy-info` items. Give the even items a different background color.
* Make `.allergy-warning` appear as a column at the center of the page.
* The descriptions in the footer should also be styled, e.g. a rounded border with a background color. They should appear in a column for mobile and in a row for desktop.

* See reference images.
