# Let's make Mario walk - DOM keyboard events

![Mario Walk](assets/mario-walk.gif)

# Description:

We want make mario walks with using keyboard.

## Task 1:

- Create a `script.js` file and link it with provided `index.html` file.

## Task 2:

- Inside `script.js` file:

- create a variable called `mario` that will contain the html element with an id `mario`,
- create a variable called `imgMario` that will contain the html `img` element,
- set source of image to `mario-stand.git` - to do this `imgMario` variable.
  > Hint: you can change `src` attribute by using
  > [src property](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/prop_img_src.asp).

## Task 3:

- create a function `stopMario"`, that will stop Mario when it's called.
  > Hint: use `src` attribute to change .gif.

## Task 4:

- create a function `moveMario`, that will listen to keyboard events;
  - you could also apply styles globally/outside the function to Mario as needed,
- check if `src` attribute is set to `mario-walk.gif` if not, set it to `mario-walk.gif`,
- check which arrow key was pressed (arrow left or arrow right) and apply right styles from description below:

#### Walk

- If the right arrow key was pressed, Mario should be moved 10 pixels to the right.
- If the left arrow key was pressed, Mario should be moved 10 pixels to the left.

#### Hold down the key

- Mario should keep moving as long as any key is pressed.

#### Rotate

- You want Mario to turn in the direction he is going.
  > Hint: An image can be [mirrored](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_flip_image.asp).

#### Stand still

- If no key is pressed, we don't want Mario to animate, but display the still image `assets/mario-stand.gif`.

## Step 5:

- Add event listener that will listen for an event when you press any key on your keyboard. Use function `moveMario` as a callback.

- Add event listener that will listen for an event when you release pressed key on your keyboard. Use function `stopMario"` as a callback.

# Good luck :)
