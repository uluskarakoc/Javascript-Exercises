# Programming Basics: Objects
[![Status overview badge](../../blob/badges/.github/badges/main/badge.svg)](#-results)


## 1. The Recipe Card

Create an object called `myRecipe` that holds information on your favorite recipe. It should have the properties `title` (a string), `servings` (a number), and `ingredients` (an array of strings).

On separate lines use console.log to log the recipe information so it looks similar to the following:
```
Title: Mole
Servings: 2
Ingredients: cinnamon, cumin, cocoa

```

## 2. The Reading List

Keep track of which books you read and which books you want to read!

* Create an array of objects named `myBooks`, where each object describes a book and has the properties `title` (a string), `author` (a string), and `alreadyRead` (a boolean indicating if you've already read it).
* Iterate through the array of books. For each book, log the book title and book author like so: "The Hobbit by J.R.R. Tolkien".
* Iterate through the array of books and this time, log messages depending on the boolean value of `alreadyRead`: Use an if/else statement to change the output depending on whether you read it yet or not. If you've read it, log a string like 'You have already read "The Hobbit" by J.R.R. Tolkien'. And if not, log a string like 'You still need to read "The Lord of the Rings" by J.R.R. Tolkien.'
