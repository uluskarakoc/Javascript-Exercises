# Promise me a modal

**Instructions**
- Create a promise that, once resolved, displays a modal to the user after the user spends 5 seconds on the page
- Investigate `index.html` and `styles/main.css`, but you don't actually have to edit them
- Add your JavaScript to `scripts/index.js`

- **BONUS** The user should be able to close the modal somehow :)
