# Logical Thinking III
[![Status overview badge](../../blob/badges/.github/badges/main/badge.svg)](#-results)


Write pseudo code for the following exercises

#### 1. Lowest to Highest
Given an array of numbers from 1 to 9: 
```javascript
[4, 2, 5, 3, 9, 7, 1, 8, 2, 6];
```
Sort the array from lowest value to highest.

#### 2. Alphabetical Order
Given an array of names:
```javascript
["Fran", "Leon", "Ale", "Jenna", "Bleda", "Hadi"];
```
Sort the array based on an alphabetical order `a ‚Üí z`. 

1. Once you've written down your pen and paper solutions, start working in the `index.js` file provided in this repository and create functions to solve the problems above with javascript named `sortNumbers` and `sortNames`. 

**Bonus**
2. Create a function that takes an array as a parameter. Order the array based off of the elements' length. Assume the elements are strings.
