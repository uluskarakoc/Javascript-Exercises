# Programming Basics: Arithmetic Operators
[![Status overview badge](../../blob/badges/.github/badges/main/badge.svg)](#-results)

 
These tasks are aimed at making you more comfortable with solving math problems using JS.

### Instructions
- **Work in `solution.js`**
- **Print each of your results to the console**
- **For the output use the pattern `Q1: xx tickets are sold` (Question number has to be included in the string)**

**Basic Arithmetic Problems**

Q1. In one night, a movie theater sells tickets for 6450 dollars. Each ticket costs 15 dollars. How many tickets were sold? 

Q2. Sylvia's income is 500 dollars per week. How much does Sylvia makes every year?

**Percentage**

Q3. Calculate the percentage of 17/30. Expected output: "Q3: [number]%" (No need to round the result)

**Geometry Formulas** 

Q4. Calculate the perimeter of a square. Assume each side is 4.75cm.

Q5. Calculate the perimeter of a triangle. Assume the length of the sides are 5cm, 6cm, 7cm.

Q6. Calculate the area of a square. Each side is 5cm.

Q7. Calculate the area of an [right-angled triangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_triangle). Assume the length of the sides are 3cm, 4cm, 5cm.

Q8. Calculate the volume of a cube. Length of each side is 9cm.

**Consumer Formula**

Q9. Calculate the three bills including tips:
- ‚Ç¨22.35 + 10% tip
- ‚Ç¨26.67 + 15% tip
- ‚Ç¨35.92 + 20% tip

Print all three results in one string to the console



**Average** 

Q10. The number of hours Noemy worked over the last two weeks are 8, 6, 5, 9, 8, 2, 1, 8.5, 7, 4
What is Noemy's average hours worked per day?

Q11. A math student scored 75, 70, 85, 90, 100 on the first five tests he took . After he took his sixth math test, the average is now 85. What did he score on the sixth test?
Expected output: "Q11: Score in the sixth test: --".

Q12. For James to get a 1st class degree, he needs to get an average of 80% in all 9 of his assessments. He has taken 8 assessments and his average is 78%. What is the minimum percentage he must get in his last assessment to ensure he gets a first class? 
Expected output: "Q12: James needs a minimum of --% to get an 80% average".
